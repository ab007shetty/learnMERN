- Hosted on GitHub Pages: [https://abshetty.in/react-basics/](https://abshetty.in/react-basics/)
- Fully **automated deployment** on every push to the `main` branch via GitHub Actions (workflow file is already included in this repo at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation from Scratch

If you want to recreate this project from scratch, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Vite Project

```bash
# Create a new Vite project with React template
npm create vite@latest react-basics -- --template react
cd react-basics
npm install
```

## ðŸ”§ Project Configuration

- Make sure the `"homepage"` field in `package.json` is set as follows (adjust for your repo):

```json
"homepage": "https://ab007shetty.github.io/react-basics/"
```

- The `dist/` folder is included in `.gitignore` since it is generated automatically.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Manual Deployment (Optional)

If you want to deploy manually instead of relying on GitHub Actions, run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This builds the app and pushes the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub.

---

## ðŸ“‚ GitHub Actions Automatic Deployment

- The workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is already included in this repo.
- On every push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions:
  - Installs dependencies
  - Runs the build script
  - Deploys the site to GitHub Pages by pushing the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch
- This means **no manual deploy commands needed** after setupâ€”just push your code!

---

## ðŸ›  GitHub Pages Settings

Make sure GitHub Pages is configured correctly in your repo:

1. Go to **Settings > Pages**.
2. Set **Source** to:
   - Branch: `gh-pages`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
3. Save changes.

Your site will then be live at:
`https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
